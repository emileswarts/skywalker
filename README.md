### Skywalker vim colourscheme

This is a dark colourscheme that I made over the course of a month.  I compiled the palette from a colours that just work together.  It consists of a wide range of greys, purples, red for search highlights, aqua blue cursor, army menu completion text, and a complimentary orange here and there.  Heavily inspired by Steve Losh's [Badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) colourscheme.

```
git clone git@github.com:emileswarts/skywalker.git ~/skywalker
mv ~/skywalker/skywalker.vim ~/.vim/colors
vim ~/.vimrc
change to colorscheme skywalker
